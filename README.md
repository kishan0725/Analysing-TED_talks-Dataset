# Analysing-TED_talks-Dataset

  In this tutorial, I have used pandas to answer questions about a real-world dataset(TED talks). Through each exercise, you'll come to know the important data science skills as well as "best practices" for using pandas. 
  
  Here are some of the topics covered:

- adjusting for bias in your dataset
- handling missing values
- choosing an appropriate plot
- customizing your plot
- using the datetime data type
- filtering using loc versus query
- using multiple aggregation functions
- checking for small sample sizes
- method chaining
- verifying your results using random samples
- evaluating a "stringifed" Python container
- applying a custom function to a Series
- writing lambda functions
